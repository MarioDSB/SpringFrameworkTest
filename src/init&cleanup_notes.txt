    To initialize/destroy multiple beans with methods which possess the same name, we can configure it in the
<beans> node, by using the "default-init-method=<initMethod>" and the "default-destroy-method=<destroyMethod"
parameters.

    Implementing init and destroy methods can also be done by implementing the InitializingBean and DisposableBean
interfaces on the classes themselves.
